# Megan Harris – Python Learning Log

## Week 1 – July 2025

**Chapter 1–4: Automate the Boring Stuff**
- Learned about strings, lists, loops, and functions.
- Practiced basic automation like text parsing.
- Struggled a bit with `for` loops, but getting better!

### Reflection:
I'm starting to see how Python can be used in my past work—like checking audit reports or analyzing lab logs. Excited to keep going.
